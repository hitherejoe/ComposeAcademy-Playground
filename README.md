![Compose Academy](compose_academy.png)

Compose Academy Playground is a free resource that provides snippets and practical samples on how to use Jetpack Compose for the Android platform.

The project is split up by API, with the intention of removing friction when trying to find the sample that you want to explore. Some Links if they are helpful:

## Jetpack Compose is still changing 🚧

The Compose APIs are still changing quite a lot, but I will be keeping this project up-to-date with any changes that occur.

## Coming soon - Compose Academy, the book and tutorial videos 📰

The main project I'm working on here is Compose Academy, a site to showcase snippets and practical examples on building projects with compose. This small app is my exploration ground whilst doing so.

I'm also currently writing a book on jetpack compose (it wont be ready for some time yet as I am being mindful of the changing APIs), based off of compose academy but the writings will be much more in depth. Once the APIs for compose are stable (and close to final), I will be creating a video course too. The best way to be aware of when these are available is to [sign-up to my newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/648900712412/signup_exploring_mobile_development).
